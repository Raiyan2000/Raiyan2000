MY STORY
</p>

I first experienced programming when I got into college without any knowledge of what it was. I started my journey learning C++ with an Arduino Inventions kit, however, I did not enjoy it as much as I thought. It was tough and the class went quickly. After 2 years into college, when working on my junior design project, I noticed that I was understanding C++ and programming concepts much more easily. As I browsed through the web to understand the microcontroller(ATmega328p) for the project, I realized that I was enjoying the research about the ways to use it. Also, around that time, I started to understand the foundational knowledge of what programming is and how it was just a tool to solve problems. Topics such as computer architecture, embedded systems, and git started to come together and make more sense. It was during the start of my third year that this happened and I became enthusiastic to learn more. From there on, I started a journey of improvement which led me to delve into projects that involved creating software games and web development. Constant improvement is how I have been living till today.
